# Scripts

This directory holds the scripts that make up the core of Minnaker.

We use `yml` instead of `yaml` for consistency (all service-settings and profiles require `yml`)

## TODOs

* Fix osx_install.sh to use kustomize
* Fix no_auth_install.sh to use kustomize
* Fix addons/ and utils/ scripts
