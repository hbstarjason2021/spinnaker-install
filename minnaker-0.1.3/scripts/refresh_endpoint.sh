# Not (currently) designed for OSX

# This is used to 'reset' a Minnaker instance.  It regenerates the Minio and Gate passwords
# Also, it will do the following with the public endpoint:
# # If a new public endpoint is provided (with the flag -P), then the new endpoint will be used
# # Otherwise, if the previous public endpoint was provided was a flag, that endpoint will be used
# # Otherwise, the public endpoint will be re-detected
